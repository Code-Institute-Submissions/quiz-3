# Simple English Quiz 

This project was a quiz made using javascript to serve as a refresher on simple english grammer.
With whats going on in the world today something like this can be seen as a good way to keep up to date on learning and help students
revise.
 
## UX
 
I wanted to make this for students going back to school as a simple quiz to refresh their minds.
I would say that the quiz forces the student to read each word carefully and a common problrm pupils have is not reading the question properly.
This hopefully ingrains a habbit to treat every word on a test wiyh attenion

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
